# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

This was a data science contest hosted by Analytics Vidhya. Sales data for various products across different stores in different cities has been provided to us in the form of train & test data. I worked on this project during the Analytics Vidhya DataHack Hour. This project required all fundamentals like data cleaning, preprocessing and visualization, outlier & missing value analysis, feature engineering, applying different models and its hyperparameter tuning to predict the sales to achieve a high accuracy.
